During my time as a student at KCC, I was part of a program that went to Jefferson Elementary School and tutored ESL students in subjects such as Math, English, and Science.

The program consisted of approximately 20 college students. We would meet at Jefferson Elementary right after school finished and help students with their homework on a one-on-one basis. During the tutoring sessions, we would not only focus on the content of the homework, but also attempt to improve their proficiency at English through conversations as well as explaining instructions about the homework that were difficult to understand. After each session, we kept a journal discussing what strategies we tried to employ as well as what seemed to work and what did not. 

After finishing the program, I gained experience working in a one-on-one setting. I continuously had to make assessments on the performance of others as well as my own. Which led to gradual improvement in my ability to teach and learn. I learned to exercise patience many times when student's attention wandered and they began to lose focus. It can also be frustrating trying to explain something you understand inherently, but are unable to communicate to someone else in a clear and easy manner. I also came to realize that you sometimes need to take a break from a problem or just try a different approach instead of banging your head against a wall.
