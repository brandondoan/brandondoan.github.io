<h1> UI Frameworks </h1>
The main purpose behind most UI frameworks is to provide a way to create sites that can be utilized and viewed from a multitude of 
devices. Because the amount of ways the internet can be accessed is growing, the ability to write code that can encompass a
majority of those platforms, is precisely what makes UI frameworks so indispensable. But a frameworks purpose is not only limited 
to that, and each framework has things to offer that others might not. My experience with UI frameworks has largely been in 
Semantic Ui, and therefore it will be the focus. 

## Why <a href="http://semantic-ui.com/">Semantic</a> UI?
<div class="ui medium right floated circular image">
  <img class="ui image" src="../images/puppy.jpg">
</div>
I asked myself this question, when I was first being introduced to UI frameworks. Hopefully, I can now answer it to some degree.
My favorite part of Semantic UI, is their own website that I linked just above. It has a complete list of every feature with
examples of the code itself. Which means, knowing about a feature is enough. Instead of memorizing the precise syntax, I can just
go to their website and find a perfect example. Semantic UI, also uses vocabulary that is easy to read and understand. If I want a 
medium circular image to float to the right , I just type the words "ui medium right floated circular image", how much simpler can 
it get? It also allows me to go back to code I've written from the past and still understand what I was trying to accomplish. 



## Is it worth the effort?
