<h1> Final Project Idea </h1>
<p>
When students are registering for classes, one issue that students encounter, is finding classes that fulfill focus requirements such as Writing Intensive or Ethics. Some of these classes have prequisites and others aren't required for every major. The information on all of this is out there, but not organized in a way that is easy to find.
</p>

<p> The student would create an account, and provide information on their major, and classes taken and the grades earned. They would then be able to search for classes based on which focus requirements that they need, and the app would provide information on all the classes available that they are able to register for.
 </p>
