Coding standards suck, there I said it. Why do I need to conform to someone else's standard of what's the proper way to write code?
The whole idea is a sisyphean task. It makes me wonder why so much emphasis is placed on it. There must be some usefulness to the
idea or there wouldn't be so much time and effort spent by companies and programmers alike ensuring that their code is up to 
standard. 

To be honest, if I stopped letting my own frustration and indignation about coding standards get in the way. I can clearly see that
their are many benefits that come with having code that is kept to a specific standard. The first and foremost in my mind is the 
ability to look at someone's coding and be able to read it with some ease. This works both ways, when I need to read someone elses
code, and when I invariably get stuck and need someone to give me a little help with my own code. It is an indispensable part of
working together in a group. Without some consistency, the coding between many individuals with different styles would be near 
incomprehensible. Progress would be slowed and people outside your group would have even more difficulty making sense of your code.
Other incentives to write in a standard include are, programs become easier to debug and code that is shared can be easily worked 
with and modified. 

Unfortunately keeping to standard is not so simple.
