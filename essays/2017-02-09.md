Coding standards suck, there I said it. Why do I need to conform to someone else's standard of what's the proper way to write 
code? The whole idea is a sisyphean task. It makes me wonder why so much emphasis is placed on it. There must be some usefulness 
to the idea or there wouldn't be so much time and effort spent by companies and programmers alike ensuring that their code is up 
to standard.

To be honest, if I stopped letting my own frustration and indignation about coding standards get in the way. I can clearly see 
that their are many benefits that come with having code that is kept to a specific standard. The first and foremost in my mind 
is the ability to look at someone's coding and be able to read it with some ease. This works both ways, when I need to read 
someone elses code, and when I invariably get stuck and need someone to give me a little help with my own code. It is an 
indispensable part of working together in a group. Without some consistency, the coding between many individuals with different 
styles would be near incomprehensible. Progress would be slowed and people outside your group would have even more difficulty 
making sense of your code. Other incentives to write in a standard include are, programs become easier to debug and code that is 
shared can be easily worked with and modified. 

Unfortunately keeping to standard is not so simple. I have a lot of habits already formed that are contrary to what the standard 
is supposed to be. Following the standard for javascript, and then having to use a completely different one for C. Makes my head 
get all scrambled up and confused. That's where linting comes in I suppose. I use to run Eclipse when I was learning to use 
Java, and it has a default coding standard that I followed. My habits learned there did not transfer to Javascript, in fact a 
lot of the time it screws me up. Having to use ESLint with Intellij is frustrating and seriously slowing me down. When your 
grade or work depends on spending your time efficiently, learning a new coding standard really hurts. I do find that having 
ESlint giving me errors does help me to learn more about Javascript. Just today I learned the "proper" way to concatenate a 
variable to a string. Learning coding standards seems to be an investment that costs time in the beginning but eventually pays 
you back that time with interest. 

So yes, I stand by original statement. Coding standards are the devil, but I suppose a necessary evil.
