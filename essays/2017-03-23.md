<h1> What is Meteor? </h1>
Like most new things I encounter, I had no idea what Meteor was, and I was a little uneasy about having to learn something 
strange and unfamiliar. So, before even getting my hands dirty I did a little research. I found that Meteor is a web 
applications framework. It allows you to write applications for a multitude of platforms, just by using javascript. One of it's 
big selling points, is it's ability to create complicated apps with just a few people. Another feature of Meteor, is it's 
ability to update information in real time. Another feature of Meteor, is the idea of MiniMongo, instead of having to access the 
database everytime, Meteor creates a small database on the client side. That's the very basic general idea of what Meteor is and 
some if it's unique features. After reading about all of that and being still a little uneasy and confused, I felt it was time 
to just start learning by doing. 

## Getting burned

When I say that using Meteor for the first couple weeks was painful, it's quite the understatement. Installing and getting 
Meteor to work was pretty difficult all in itself. I'm not using that great of a laptop, and to add to that, I use Windows 10.
So even after getting Meteor installed and running, I would literally spend hours trying to get a template saved, indexed and 
running on my computer. Then and only then could I even start learning to use Meteor. When my app was finally up and running, I
was excited to start learning to make some apps. Unfortunately, the first few days of going through the tutorials, everything 
seemed like greek to me

## After the impact

Learning a UI frameworks is all good, but what happens when a "new and better" one comes along. Does that mean I'm going to have 
to learn everything all over again? At the speed frameworks are being created I could never keep up. I think my time would be better spent deciding which framework is best for me, and figuring out what I'm attempting to accomplish. Sometimes, I might 
not even want to use a framework at all. If I'm trying to create a site that is specifically for a certain device, focusing on writing code that utilizes
the devices features becomes much more important than creating a site that has to take into account other devices. Whenever I find myself stressing too much over which framework to use, or I just need a break from all the coding, I think I'll just click 
on the picture of the puppy. You should try it too.
