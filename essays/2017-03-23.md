<h1> What is Meteor? </h1>
Like most new things I encounter, I had no idea what Meteor was, and I was a little uneasy about having to learn something 
strange and unfamiliar. So, before even getting my hands dirty I did a little research. I found that Meteor is a web 
applications framework. It allows you to write applications for a multitude of platforms, just by using javascript. One of it's 
big selling points, is it's ability to create complicated apps with just a few people. One feature of Meteor, is it's 
ability to update information in real time. Once a change is made, the page is almost instanteously updated
Another nifty feature of Meteor, is the idea of MiniMongo, instead of having to access the database everytime, Meteor creates a 
small database on the client side. That's the very basic general idea of what Meteor is and some if it's unique features. After 
reading about all of that and being still a little uneasy and confused, I felt it was time to just start learning by doing. 

## Getting burned

When I say that using Meteor for the first couple weeks was painful, it's quite the understatement. Installing and getting 
Meteor to work was pretty difficult all in itself. I'm not using that great of a laptop, and to add to that, I use Windows 10.
So even after getting Meteor installed and running, I would literally spend hours trying to get a template saved, indexed and 
running on my computer. Then and only then could I even start learning to use Meteor. When my app was finally up and running, I
was excited to start learning to make some apps. Unfortunately, the first few days of going through the tutorials, everything 
seemed like greek to me. I was going through the motions and it felt like I wasn't learning anything. But, there was a turning 
point. Eventually, some of the ideas and concepts were becoming familiar and I was understanding more of what the tutorials were
saying and the purpose behind the different files and methods. 

## After the impact

I still am not very great at Meteor, but I am bit more familiar with it, and there are some things that I appreciate about it. 
The autoupdating of the page while I'm working makes troubleshooting problems a lot easier. It also is encouraging to see my 
efforts showing fruit right away. It also makes me happy to know I can get by on Meteor, with my rudimentary knowledge in
javascript. I don't have to learn a bunch of other languages to get an app started. I still have a very large hatred for 
creating new projects, getting stuff running and indexed still takes so much time. I've learned that I should just walk away
from my computer and get other stuff done. Just knowing that I have to wait, allows me to plan ahead and manage my time better. 
I also have heard rumors of them improving these problems down the road. But once again, I gotta play the waiting game.
