Up to this point, my entire computer programming experience has been a solo endeavor. Therefore, Configuration Management is something completely new to me. 
Before taking ICS 314, I've heard about github, linux, shells, and the like, but honestly, I've never needed to learn what they were or how to use them. 
The only thing I'm slightly familiar with is Eclipse. I'm excited to finally learn about all the things I've heard so much about, although setting everything
up and learning how to use them all is a daunting task. I've already banged my head in frustration a few times since I started. It is slowly starting to come
together, and once everything is set up, I'm interested to see how much easier it makes my life.
