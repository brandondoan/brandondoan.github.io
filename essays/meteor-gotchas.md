<h1> Difficulties found in Meteor</h1>

<p>Just starting to learn Meteor has been a very frustrating experience for me. Something that is suppose to make my life easier, has only made it harder up to this point. Each time I use Meteor, I can expect to run into some of the same problems, and also encounter a few more along the way. 
 </p>
 <p>By far the worst thing that I can say about Meteor is the amouont of time I waste waiting for the app to install and index. It's a problem that I have not been able to fix even now. Every project that I have worked on so far, the majority of the time has been spent downloading and installing the updates or indexing the files. What makes it worse is the amount of time, I've spent trying to figure out how to fix these issues. First off, working in windows just seems to make thing's that much harder. I've tried disabling my firewall's and defender, I've tried invalidating my caches, nothing has had any effect so far. When I'm working on projects that are time sensitive, tt makes me want to throw my laptop against the wall.
 </p>
 <p>Another smaller issue that I haven't been able to fix, is getting eslint to work with Meteor. I have tried going to my preferences and changing the directories on where it is supposed to be found at. But, I am still unable to get it to work. Which leads me to another problem I have with using Meteor. I am unable to reformat my code to make it look nice and more readable, and because of that, it takes me a long time to catch errors in my code that are the result of typos or missing semicolons or brackets.</p>
 <p>A problem that I had initially struggle with, but I am slowly getting better at, is mostly how Meteor files are setup. There are just so many folders and each folder has multiple files that all do certain things. It's strange for me to see tons of tons of js and html files. Each one has only so much code, and everything has to be imported and if you mess that up your page might not load properly or at all. I feel that the more that I work with Meteor though, the less I forget to import my files as well as troubleshooting when I run into problems. I think the best way to improve, is to just put in the time and experience all the problems meteor can throw at you. Eventually you'll know most of the causes and how to fix them. </p>
